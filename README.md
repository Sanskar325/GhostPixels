# 🕵️‍♂️ StegoCrypt — Image Steganography with AES Encryption

**StegoCrypt** is a lightweight, offline cryptography tool that hides encrypted messages inside images using **AES encryption** and **LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography**. It’s built for privacy enthusiasts, students, and developers who want to explore how encryption and steganography can work together for secure communication.
